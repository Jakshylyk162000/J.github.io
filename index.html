                My name is Jaskylyk Kojobekov. I am a student
                in third course. Everyone can agree
                that I am a good student and that I
                like to study. My favorite subjects
                are informatics.I have aim, in future
                i want to be professional programmer.
                <p class="i-can">I can say that I am a responsible
                    and a hard-working student.
                    Moreover, being a sociable
                    person, I have many friends
                    since I like to communicate
                    with people and get to know
                    new interesting individuals.
                    I enjoy my time at university:
                    it is really nice to study,
                    the students are very friendly
                    and ready to help. The atmosphere
                    cannot but make me want to go
                    there every time. I like to
                    receive and deal with challenging
                    tasks. I am a very enthusiastic
                    student and I think this is a
                    strong point of mine.
                </p>
                <div class="goal">
                    <p class="">
                        The goal I’m currently striving for
                        is to make this world a better place to
                        live in by starting the changes with myself.
                        Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too,
                        but this is exactly what made me the way
                        I am now: grateful, full of love, with a
                        desire to study well because it will help
                        me become a successful person in future
                        and have a high quality of life. I believe
                        that it is manifesting day by day and I
                        feel even more responsibility for what I
                        do and where I go. With all I already have,
                        I know that I’m on the right path and I will
                        do my best to inspire others to live the way
                        they feel like living as well.

                    as to why they love Gmail. It's
                    relatively easy to catch spam
                    messages; the challenge is to
                    catch the right messages without
                    blocking mail that you want along the way.</p>
